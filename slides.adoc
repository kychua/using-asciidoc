On a contract assignment, the owner of a small industrial control software company told me â€œWe do not want our (end-user) documentation to be too clear. We make a lot of money doing training."

[NOTES]

Unfortunately, for most of us, we don't have users who are willing to pay for training. Instead, what happens is thats poorly written or worse, non-existent. 

The same thing goes for developer guides as well. Without proper, updated cos, it is difficult for develoeprs to work on and improve your software - and that includes yourself, looking at code you wrote 6 months ago!

So clearly, having good documenetation is important. I'm sure we all know this already. 

Yet, when it comes to writing documentation, this is what happens instead:

we procrastinate...

[NOTES]
====
We procrastinate, be it updating the docs, or even writing them in the first place, because we find them boring, difficult or troublesome

so today, I want to introduce you a new tool for writing documentation (specifically, UG & DG): AsciiDoc & AsciiDoctor
